#LLSN-Project

I’m just reinventing the wheel to stay sane. My productivity is... let’s say, unpredictable. One week I might drop dozens of commits in a sudden burst of inspiration, and the next, I might do absolutely nothing. It’s a hobby, not a job.

If you see something broken, feel free to point it out. If you have a brilliant idea, let me know—I might actually build it if I’m in the mood. No promises, though. I’m just here to enjoy the process and keep the daily grind at bay.
